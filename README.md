# PanicAtTheSchool
CAPP 30122 Group Project: Sarah, Eshan, and Amari

Our aim is to assess 2 worrying trends observed by Chicago Public Schools in the last decade: a) a decrease in enrolment by 16% and b) decrease in grade-level proficiency by more than 40 p.p. (https://www.illinoispolicy.org/one-third-of-chicago-public-schools-are-half-full/) 
News agencies covering this issue have attributed these trends to the emergence and solidification of Chicago Teacher’s Union. While we’re unsure as of now whether we can validate that relationship through data scraping or any other means, we want to investigate other variables that might have impacted enrolment and learning trends.  
Specifically, we want to look at a few things: a) emergence of private schools near public schools, b) the closure of public schools, and c) crime rates in school districts. We want to see whether students are leaving CPS and moving elsewhere, or whether they are possibly leaving the school system altogether. We are also interested in looking at whether academically poor performing school districts have steadily lower enrolment and higher crime rates. This idea is derived from the school-to-prison pipeline theory.  
Finally, we intend to look at some steps CPS, and possibly other school organizations across the US have taken to increase student engagement and performance and see the extent to which those steps have worked.
