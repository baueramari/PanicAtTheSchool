# PanicAtTheSchool
CAPP 30122 Group Project: Sarah, Eshan, and Amari


Our aim of this project is to assess factors which may be contributing to low attendance rates in Chicago public high schools. Based on attendance data from Chicago Public Schools (CPS), grades 9-12 show the lowest attendance rates of all grade levels in the last decade, at an average of about 86.51% before 2019. Moreover, there was a noticeable drop in attendance post-COVID, with high school atteandance rates falling to an average of about 78.79% in school years 2021 and 2022 following the pandemic. 

In our investigation we used publically available CPS data, an API from City of Chicago crime data, and ____ to find sources to investigate factors in attendance. We have broken down our study into two main focus areas: the relationship between school misconducts and community crime rates as an influence on the criminalization of students (which we hypothesized may be associated with changes in attendance), 

News agencies covering this issue have attributed these trends to the emergence and solidification of the Chicago Teachers Union. While weâ€™re not looking into those claims through this project, we want to investigate other variables that might have impacted attendance. Specifically, we want to look at 3 buckets: 
  a) Neighborhood indicators: These will cover:
Demographic build up of school neighborhood
Socioeconomic indicators - employment, income etc. 
Health indicators 
Accessibility indicators such as walkability score, access to public transport etc.    
  b) Investment in school indicators: These will cover:
Per pupil budget for schools
Teacher distribution by race/qualification
Attendance distribution by school type
  c) Crime and punishment indicators:
Crime in the school neighborhood 
Suspensions/expulsions handed out by school authorities 
Through our analysis, we want to see which of these factors impacts attendance the most. Finally, we will visualize our results on a web-app and write down some potential next steps based on research of news articles/interviews with CPS employees.
